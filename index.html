        <h1>What is the project?</h1>
        <p>This project aims to create a simple ping pong game using an Arduino board for physical control and p5.js 
          for graphical display and interaction. The game will simulate the classic ping pong experience where players 
          control paddles to hit a ball back and forth.</p>

        <h1>Game Details</h1>
        <p>This is a 2 player recreated version of the classic pong game. One player 
          controls the paddle with buttons, while the other controls the other paddle with a joystick. There is 3 LEDs for each
          player, which indicates how many points they have, the first player to reach 3 points wins the game.</p>
        <p>What makes this unique from the classic pong game is that the ball gradually speeds up, 
          making the game more difficult, thus making it more interesting.</p>

        <p>Made the ball speed increase as time goes on to make the game more interesting</p>

        <h1>Future Development Ideas</h1>
        <h3>Enhanced Visual Effects</h3>
        <p>Introduce multiplayer functionality to allow two players to compete against each other. This could involve implementing networking capabilities to enable real-time gameplay between players on different devices.</p>
        <h3>Enhanced Visual Effects</h3>
        <p>Enhance the game's visuals with animations, particle effects, and dynamic lighting.</p>
        <h3>Community Features</h3>
        <p>Implement community features such as leaderboards, achievements, and social sharing functionality. Enable players to compete
        with friends, share their high scores, and participate in online tournaments.</p>
