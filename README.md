This is a 2 player recreated version of the classic pong game. One player controls the paddle with buttons, while the other controls the other paddle with a joystick. There is 3 LEDs for each player, which indicates how many points they have, the first player to reach 3 points wins the game.

What makes this unique from the classic pong game is that the ball gradually speeds up, making the game more difficult, thus making it more interesting.
